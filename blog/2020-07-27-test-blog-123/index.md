Here is an example from the section “WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED”



\> \*\*Compare.\*\* To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances, between objects regarded as essentially of

\> different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences, between objects regarded as essentially of

\> the same order. Thus life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared

\> with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.
