Here is what you can look forward to in this book:

\* \- Eight rules of usage

\* \- Ten rules of composition

\* \- List of commonly misused/misspelled words

\* \- Beautiful explanation on sentence structure and parallelism

\* \- And many more.

Here is an example from the section â€œWORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED

\> \*\*Compare.\*\* To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances, between objects regarded as essentially of

\> different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences, between objects regarded as essentially of

\> the same order. Thus life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared

\> with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.

This book is carefully revised and polished over several editions. If you have a passion for clear and concise writing, go buy the book.
