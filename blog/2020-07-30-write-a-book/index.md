A well-written abstract should be reflective of the overall contents of the research article. By skimming through it, the reader should be able to understand the focus of the work and its relevance to their area of interest, thereby determining whether the full text warrants their attention. It should be succinct, around 200â€“250 words in length so that the reader is not burdened with too much information, but at the same time effectively convey the crux of the topic. Besides, the abstract should be self-explanatory, that is, the reader should be able to grasp the subject without referring to the main text.
